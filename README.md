This is a repository for the cell-type-classifier models using rSuperCT package. The models were trained using SuperCT framework in Python as there is no good machine learning package in R. 

The rSuperCT user may download the models and use them in the prediction of your UMI-based single-cell RNAseq data. Please note, the model should be selected based on the biological context of the scRNAseq data. The performance of rSuperCT will be better if the model is chosen correctly.
